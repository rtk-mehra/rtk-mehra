👋 Hey, I'm Ritik!
💻 Backend Wizard | Node.js Pro | Database Architect | Open Source Contributor

I’m a passionate backend engineer, specializing in building blazing fast, scalable applications with Node.js and PostgreSQL at the core. Crafting elegant APIs, designing robust data models, and optimizing complex queries—that’s my jam. I thrive in high-impact environments where performance and scalability matter.

🚀 Tech Stack Highlights:

Backend:

⚙️ Node.js, Express.js, Koa.js
📡 RESTful APIs, GraphQL, Microservices
🔑 Auth strategies (JWT, OAuth, SSO)
Databases:

🐘 PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
🗃️ Sequelize ORM, Knex.js, Raw SQL
🔥 Efficient query optimization, advanced indexing
DevOps & Cloud:

🐳 Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
☁️ AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku
📦 Redis, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch
Frontend (I dabble here too):

⚛️ React.js, Next.js
🎨 TailwindCSS, JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3
📱 Responsive Design & SSR
🧩 Core Skills:

Scalable API Architect: Designing APIs that handle thousands of requests like a breeze.
SQL Guru: Crafting complex queries and optimizing database performance.
Cloud Deployment: Deploying apps on Kubernetes and Docker with CI/CD pipelines.
Authentication/Authorization: Implementing secure OAuth, JWT, and custom auth flows.
Real-Time Systems: Event-driven architecture, using WebSockets for live updates.
File Handling: Efficient handling and serving files through AWS S3 and DO Spaces.
🔥 Always Learning:

Right now, I’m diving deep into:

🚀 Go for high-performance backends
⚙️ Rust for systems-level programming
🧠 Machine Learning with Python and TensorFlow
🔗 Blockchain tech & Smart Contracts
