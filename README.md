👋 Hi, I'm Ritik!
🔧 Backend Developer | Node.js Enthusiast | Database Nerd | Open-Source Contributor

I am a passionate backend developer with expertise in building scalable, high-performance applications using Node.js, PostgreSQL, and SQL. I thrive in crafting efficient APIs, designing data models, and ensuring smooth database operations. I enjoy tackling complex problems and architecting solutions that are both functional and elegant.

💻 Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Koa.js, RESTful APIs, GraphQL
Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Sequelize ORM, Knex.js
Cloud & DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, DigitalOcean, AWS, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
Frontend: React.js, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), TailwindCSS
Other Tools: Git, Redis, RabbitMQ, WebSockets, Elasticsearch, NGINX
🌟 What I'm Good At:
Building RESTful APIs and GraphQL APIs that scale
Creating robust and maintainable SQL queries and database schemas
Implementing authentication and authorization strategies (OAuth, JWT, etc.)
Efficient file handling and content delivery with cloud services (AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces)
Developing microservices and handling inter-service communication
Deploying applications on Kubernetes, Docker, and Cloud Platforms (DigitalOcean, AWS)
🧠 Open to Learning:
While I love working with Node.js and databases, I'm always excited to dive into new technologies. Whether it's a new framework, a cutting-edge cloud service, or even learning different programming languages, I'm open to expanding my skill set.

Some of the tech I’m currently exploring:

Go for building high-performance services
Rust for systems programming
Machine Learning integrations with Python and TensorFlow
Blockchain technology and smart contracts
🏗️ Frontend Experience:
Though backend development is my core expertise, I also enjoy working on the frontend side. I’ve built user interfaces with:

React.js and Next.js for SPAs and server-side rendering
CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS for rapid UI development
Implementing responsive design and interactive UI elements
